First, I designed and implemented a relational data model (RDM) based on the real estate market using MySQL Workbench. Then, I compiled and recorded data in Microsoft Access. Using the populated database, I performed multiple complex SQL queries that would answer interesting analytical questions about the real estate market. Finally I populated the database with forms and a report. 

The questions answered include:

  1) What, if any, is the correlation between the population density of a zip code and the size of an apartment/house in NY? 
  2) What is the annual salary of each real estate agent in the database?
  3) What, if any, is the correlation between the average price of an apartment/house and state GDP?
  4) Does age have any effect on the length of one's mortgage?
  5) Are people more likely to buy a house from someone who is the same race as them? 
  6) Report the total number of homebuyers and the average price of the houses they purchase, group by age bracket.
  7) What, if any, is the correlation between a real estate agent's years of experience and the prices of the apartments/houses they sell?
