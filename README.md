First, I designed and implemented a relational data model (RDM) based on the real estate market using MySQL Workbench. Then, I compiled and recorded data in Mircrosft Access. Using the populated database, I performed multiple complex SQL queries that would answer interesting analytical questions about the real estate market. Finally I populated the database with forms for each table and a report. 

The questions answered include:
  1) Is there a correlation between the population density of a zip code and the size of an apartment/house in        NYC? 
  2) What is the annual salary of the real estate agents in the database?
  3) Is there a correlation between the average price of an apartment/house and state GDP?
  4) How is the average mortgage loan duration affected by one's age?
  5) Are people more likely to buy a house from someone who is the same race as them?
  6) How does the number of homebuyers and the average house price differ depend on a person's age?
  7) Are more experienced real estate agents selling more expensive houses that inexperienced real estate agents?
